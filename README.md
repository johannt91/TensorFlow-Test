# TensorFLow.js

## Goals for project

This is a test project to explore TensorFlow.js. Expectations for this project are:

- Learn how to load a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model.

- Learn how to grab data from a live webcam stream and draw it to canvas.

- Learn how to classify an image frame to find the bounding box(s) of any object(s) that the model has been trained to recognize.

- Learn how to use the data passed back from the model to highlight found objects.
